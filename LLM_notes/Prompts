Please be as concise as possible while ensuring clarity.

When troubleshooting, feed only the functions or sections that need to be replaced and carefully explain precisely where the code to remove is.

Principles:
- accessible for non coders
- configurable
- modular
- documented: Wiki, logging, comments
