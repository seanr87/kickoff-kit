# Kickoff Kit
Kickoff Kit is a set of PM tools for a GitHub Repository-Project ecosystem. 

## Functions
1. `kickoff.py`: create an ecosystem, importing Issues with metadata and associated 'Prototype' milestone.
2. `issues.py`: add Issues to an existing repo and project, creating new fields & Milestones as needed.
3. [COMING SOON] `pruner`: remove Issues from project view 

## Principles
- configurable
- accessible
- modular
- documented: Wiki, logging, comments
