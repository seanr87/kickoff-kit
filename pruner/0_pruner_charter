# Project Charter: Pruner

## Purpose
Automatically manage GitHub Project boards by labeling — not deleting — old, irrelevant, or non-actionable Issues to keep boards clean and focused.

## User Experience
- **No Issues are ever deleted**.
- **Users do not manually intervene** to prune Issues.
- **Old or irrelevant Issues** automatically **disappear** from view via label-based filters.
- **All Issues remain accessible** for auditing or recovery.

## Workflow
1. **Scan GitHub Project**:
   - Pull all Issues and metadata: status, closed reason, closed date, and workstream.
2. **Apply Labels**:
   - `Not Planned`: Closed with reason "not planned."
   - `Archive`: 
     - In `Done` for 2+ weeks, **or**
     - More than 3 Issues in `Done` per workstream (label oldest first).
3. **Update Filters**:
   - Exclude Issues with `Not Planned` or `Archive` labels from the Project board view.
